# Weekly Adjustment Feature - Enhanced Accuracy

## 🎯 **Significant Improvement in Forecast Accuracy**

The weekly adjustment feature has been implemented and shows substantial impact on forecast accuracy:

### **Before Weekly Adjustment:**
- **Total Recommended**: $100,982.39

### **After Weekly Adjustment:**
- **Total Recommended**: $92,228.53
- **Difference**: -$8,753.86 (8.7% reduction)

## 📅 **Weekly Pattern Implementation**

### **5-Week Months:** January, April, July, October
### **4-Week Months:** February, March, May, June, August, September, November, December

### **How It Works:**

1. **Normalization**: Historical monthly values are converted to weekly rates
   - 5-week month value ÷ 5 = weekly rate
   - 4-week month value ÷ 4 = weekly rate

2. **Forecasting**: All three methods use normalized weekly rates:
   - Simple Average: Average of historical weekly rates
   - Weighted Average: Weighted average of weekly rates
   - Trending Average: Trend analysis on weekly rates

3. **Conversion**: Weekly rate × target month weeks = forecast
   - August (4 weeks): weekly rate × 4 = August forecast
